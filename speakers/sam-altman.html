      <div class="section-label"><span class="num">01</span> AI coding agents crossed a threshold <span class="line"></span></div>
      <p>Altman opened with a personal confession: Codex, OpenAI's coding agent, gave him his biggest "update" on AI in a long time — <strong>a second ChatGPT moment</strong>. He anchored this immediately in Cisco's own experience, noting G2's team would have 100% of AI Defense code written by Codex within weeks. Not a demo — a proof point from the interviewer's own company.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="narrative-section" id="s2" data-section="s2">
      <div class="section-label"><span class="num">02</span> Endgame: full AI companies <span class="line"></span></div>
      <p>From there he escalated deliberately. He moved from coding agents to <span class="highlight">"full AI companies"</span> — AI that doesn't just write software but builds a business around it. Called it "the upper limit I can currently think about," his way of saying the ceiling keeps moving.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="narrative-section" id="s3" data-section="s3">
      <div class="section-label"><span class="num">03</span> The two-hour capitulation <span class="line"></span></div>
      <p>Then came a fascinatingly honest admission. He installed Codex, swore he'd never give it full control — <strong>lasted about two hours</strong> before caving because it was too useful. Now runs two laptops because he couldn't resist giving AI full access to his sessions. This personal anecdote conveyed more about agentic AI's power than any benchmark.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pull-quote">
      <p>"I swore I'd never give Codex full control of my computer. That lasted about two hours."</p>

    <div class="narrative-section" id="s4" data-section="s4">
      <div class="section-label"><span class="num">04</span> Your software stack will break <span class="line"></span></div>
      <p>He laid out what he sees as the real blockers — and none were about model intelligence. First: the security and data access paradigm hasn't been invented yet. Second: software needs rewriting for dual human-AI use. He illustrated this with a wonderfully mundane example — his AI agent reads Slack threads but marks everything as read, breaking his workflow. A "silly" example aimed directly at every CIO in the room: <strong>your software stack isn't built for a world where agents and humans share the same tools</strong>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="insight-card">
      <div class="label">Key Insight</div>
      <p>The real blockers aren't about model intelligence. They're about the fact that <strong>your existing software stack isn't built for a world where agents and humans share the same tools.</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="narrative-section" id="s5" data-section="s5">
      <div class="section-label"><span class="num">05</span> The capability overhang <span class="line"></span></div>
      <p>The deepest concept was the <span class="highlight">"capability overhang"</span> — the gap between what AI <em>can</em> do and what organizations actually use it for. He said this gap feels bigger now than it was right before ChatGPT launched, even though everyone's already using AI. His advice was blunt: companies that can't quickly adopt "AI co-workers" will be at a huge disadvantage, and getting there requires thinking of AI as a <strong>teammate, not a tool</strong>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pull-quote">
      <p>"The capability overhang — the gap between what AI can do and what people are doing with it — is the largest it's ever been."</p>

      <div class="section-label"><span class="num">06</span> 10x better by end of 2026 <span class="line"></span></div>
      <p>He closed on scale, framing AI demand like electricity — infinite at the right price. Predicted a <strong>10x improvement in models by end of 2026</strong>. When pressed on imagination limits, offered a vision from billions of humanoid robots to Von Neumann probes in space — then admitted "beyond that, I got no idea." A rare moment of genuine humility from someone who otherwise projected total conviction that AI is about to reshape everything.</p>

          <div class="qt-tldr">We are in a period of "capability overhang" where models are far more powerful than current usage reflects, and the shift to "agentic" workflows — where AI acts as a teammate rather than a tool — is the next massive transformation.</div>
