    <div class="narrative-section" id="s1" data-section="s1">
      <div class="section-label"><span class="num">01</span> Three continents of disruption <span class="line"></span></div>
      <p>Chuck Robbins introduced TK with palpable personal conviction — they've known each other 14 years and built infrastructure together across continents. TK's credentials are staggering: at Reliance Jio, he helped build 400,000 macro base stations, a million Wi-Fi access points, and hundreds of data centers, onboarding a million customers <em>per day</em> in a country that went from 154th in global data access to number one.</p>
      <p>TK framed his career journey as a deliberate education: <strong>India taught him scale, Japan taught him precision, Saudi Arabia taught him ambition and vision.</strong> It wasn't just biography — it was context for why he believed he could pull off the most ambitious AI infrastructure play outside the United States. He'd done the impossible before. Repeatedly.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="narrative-section" id="s2" data-section="s2">
      <div class="section-label"><span class="num">02</span> The energy advantage <span class="line"></span></div>
      <p>While every other speaker at the summit talked about power constraints as AI's binding bottleneck, TK smiled through a very different narrative. Saudi Arabia's unique value proposition is simple: <span class="highlight">energy abundance</span>. Power available today is north of <strong>15 gigawatts of capacity</strong>, not just traditional energy but 20% renewable at effective cost. Total cost of ownership for AI data centers could be 20-30% cheaper than anywhere else.</p>
      <p>This isn't theoretical. Humane's data center segment — Humane Core — is already securing sites with existing power substations and adjacent government land. The company had committed to building Amazon's first AI factory outside the US in Saudi Arabia. While American hyperscalers wrestle with utility companies growing at 3-5% annually, TK was describing a country where the power is already there, the land is already identified, and the government is actively clearing the path.</p>

    <div class="pull-quote">
      <p>"There is no more apps, the apps disappear."</p>
      <div class="attribution">— TK / Tarek Amin, on the Agentic OS</div>
    </div>

    <div class="narrative-section" id="s3" data-section="s3">
      <div class="section-label"><span class="num">03</span> Government as business enabler <span class="line"></span></div>
      <p>The most jaw-dropping moment of TK's segment was his description of Saudi government speed. He went to the Minister of Energy — the Crown Prince's brother — with a simple ask: identify substations with available power and adjacent government land. <strong>In less than six weeks</strong>, 16 government entities came together in a war room at the Ministry of Energy. The result: 211 pieces of land identified, north of 14 gigawatts of tappable capacity, no substation construction needed.</p>
      <p>"Something very unique about government in Saudi Arabia," TK observed. <strong>"It feels like it's a business."</strong> The government structures operate as <span class="highlight">enablement platforms</span>, not just regulatory gatekeepers. This isn't how government works in India, Japan, or the US — and it's why TK believes Saudi Arabia can build AI infrastructure at a pace that will surprise the world.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="insight-card">
      <div class="label">Key Insight</div>
      <p>The geopolitical balance of AI is shifting. Energy-rich nations are moving from being <strong>passive technology consumers</strong> to active AI infrastructure builders. Saudi Arabia's 15+ GW of available power capacity — the primary constraint for AI data centers globally — gives it a structural advantage that pure technology leadership can't easily overcome.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="narrative-section" id="s4" data-section="s4">
      <div class="section-label"><span class="num">04</span> The agentic operating system <span class="line"></span></div>
      <p>Then TK revealed something he'd never shared publicly before. Humane has built what it claims is the <strong>world's first agentic operating system</strong> — a customized Linux distribution where applications are deliberately made second-class citizens. Users declare intent and agents carry out the work. Payroll, performance management, procurement, finance — none of Humane's employees see an app. They interact with agents.</p>
      <p><span class="highlight">Humane OS</span> was launching in April, alongside Humane One, a multi-agent orchestration platform. TK drew a deliberate parallel to 1985, when Windows created the "ChatGPT moment" of its era. His argument: just as the GUI paradigm replaced command lines, the <strong>agentic paradigm will replace apps</strong>. The enterprise isn't seeing productivity gains from AI because everyone is gluing models onto legacy platforms. The answer is rethinking the operating model entirely.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="narrative-section" id="s5" data-section="s5">
      <div class="section-label"><span class="num">05</span> A living lab for AI transformation <span class="line"></span></div>
      <p>TK's closing argument tied everything together. He wasn't just building infrastructure and selling AI services — he was <strong>using Humane itself as a living lab</strong> to prove that AI-native enterprise operations deliver the productivity gains that everyone else is struggling to find. No legacy systems. No inherited workflows. Every process designed from scratch for an agentic world.</p>
      <p>The credibility play was deliberate: before he could advise other enterprises on AI transformation, he needed to demonstrate it in his own. And the results, he claimed, validated what the industry suspects but can't yet prove — that you <strong>cannot just take a model, glue it on top of legacy platforms, and expect productivity</strong>. You need the right partners, the right ecosystem, and the willingness to build from zero. It was infrastructure disruption logic applied to enterprise software, from someone who has disrupted infrastructure at nation-scale three times before.</p>
