    <div class="narrative-section" id="s1" data-section="s1">
      <div class="section-label"><span class="num">01</span> The alliance advantage <span class="line"></span></div>
      <p>Where his co-panelist Anne Neuberger framed AI through the lens of defense and cyber warfare, Brett McGurk took a wider aperture. His central thesis was deceptively simple: <strong>America's greatest advantage over its adversaries isn't technological — it's relational</strong>. The US has something China and Russia fundamentally lack: a global network of allies who <em>want</em> to cooperate. Dozens of nations with shared values, interoperable systems, and decades of trust built through treaty alliances and joint operations. In the AI race, McGurk argued, this network is a <span class="highlight">force multiplier</span> that no amount of compute can replicate.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="narrative-section" id="s2" data-section="s2">
      <div class="section-label"><span class="num">02</span> Technology sharing is strength <span class="line"></span></div>
      <p>McGurk challenged the instinct — common in both Silicon Valley and Washington — to hoard technological advantage. Sharing advanced AI capabilities with allies, he argued, is not giving away the store. It's <strong>building collective strength</strong>. When the US shares technology with Japan, Australia, the UK, or NATO partners, it creates an ecosystem of capability that compounds. Each ally develops applications, surfaces edge cases, contributes data, and extends the reach of American-origin AI into domains and geographies the US cannot cover alone. The alternative — treating AI as a zero-sum resource — leaves allies dependent on whoever <em>will</em> share, and that might be Beijing.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="narrative-section" id="s3" data-section="s3">
      <div class="section-label"><span class="num">03</span> Export controls and the chip war <span class="line"></span></div>
      <p>The discussion turned granular when McGurk addressed <span class="highlight">export controls on AI chips</span>. He acknowledged the strategic logic — denying China access to cutting-edge American semiconductors constrains their AI development in the short term. But he was candid about the second-order effects: restrictions motivate China to build its own chip ecosystem, invest massively in domestic semiconductor capability, and ultimately leapfrog the very controls designed to contain it. It's the classic sanctions dilemma applied to silicon, and McGurk didn't pretend there were easy answers. The policy, he suggested, must be <strong>dynamic and adaptive</strong>, not a static wall.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="narrative-section" id="s4" data-section="s4">
      <div class="section-label"><span class="num">04</span> The technology cold war <span class="line"></span></div>
      <p>McGurk didn't use the phrase "cold war" lightly, but his framing left little ambiguity. The US and China are engaged in a <strong>technology competition with civilizational stakes</strong>. It's not just about who builds the best model — it's about whose values get embedded in the AI systems that will increasingly govern commerce, education, media, and governance worldwide. He connected this directly to the alliance strategy: the more countries that run on American-origin AI, the more the global digital infrastructure reflects democratic norms. The more that run on Chinese AI, the more it reflects <span class="highlight">authoritarian governance models</span>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="insight-card">
      <div class="label">Key Insight</div>
      <p>The AI race isn't just about building the best model. It's about whose <strong>values get embedded in the systems that will govern the world</strong>. Alliances aren't just a military strategy — they're a technology distribution network for democratic norms.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="narrative-section" id="s5" data-section="s5">
      <div class="section-label"><span class="num">05</span> Architecture of security <span class="line"></span></div>
      <p>McGurk closed by arguing that the <span class="highlight">international security architecture</span> — the system of alliances, treaties, and institutions built after World War II — must be fundamentally updated for the AI era. The institutions designed for nuclear deterrence and conventional warfare aren't equipped for a world where the decisive strategic capability is software that improves itself every quarter. New frameworks for AI governance, technology sharing agreements, and collective defense against AI-enabled threats are needed — and the US must lead their creation. His final point was sobering: if the US doesn't build this architecture, <strong>someone else will</strong>, and it won't reflect American values.</p>
