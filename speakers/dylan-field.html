      <div class="section-label"><span class="num">01</span> Roles aren't blurring — responsibilities are <span class="line"></span></div>
      <p>Dylan Field opened with a refreshingly honest revision of his own prior thinking. He'd previously been "very vocally saying" that AI would blur the lines between roles — engineer, designer, PM, researcher, all collapsing into one. But he's changed his mind. <strong>The roles aren't blurring; the responsibilities are.</strong> What AI actually does is pull everyone toward being a <span class="highlight">generalist</span>. If you're a designer blocked by your PM, that's no longer an excuse — you should just go solve the problem. If you're an engineer who needs a quick design, you can prototype it yourself. The specializations still matter — people remain "spiky" in certain areas, which is why roles persist — but the expectation that everyone can contribute across boundaries is becoming the new baseline. "More people are going to prototype, more people are going to design," Field said, "and I also think more people will be talking with customers."</p>

      <div class="section-label"><span class="num">02</span> The MS-DOS era of AI <span class="line"></span></div>
      <p>Field offered one of the summit's most vivid analogies: we're in the <span class="highlight">"MS-DOS era" of AI</span>. The prompt box — that blank text field where you type instructions and wait for output — is just the most primitive interface for navigating latent space. "This is just one way to navigate latent space," he said, "and ultimately you're just trying to figure out a way to get to this hyperdimensional space and make the right activations." Brian Chesky of Airbnb apparently agrees with this framing, and Field was excited that the idea was catching on. The implication was profound: just as graphical interfaces transformed computing from a specialist tool into a universal one, the next generation of AI interfaces will move far beyond prompting — toward <strong>multiplayer collaboration</strong> where agents and humans work alongside each other in shared canvases, not in isolated sandboxes. Long-running agents might operate for a year. But auditability will remain essential: "If you're somebody that is just blindly trusting an agent right now, then you're a very brave person."</p>

      <div class="attribution">— Dylan Field, on taste as differentiator</div>
    </div>

    <div class="narrative-section" id="s3" data-section="s3">
      <div class="section-label"><span class="num">03</span> Taste as the scarce commodity <span class="line"></span></div>
      <p>Jeetu Patel pressed Field on what happens when AI can generate fifty design variations from a single prompt. If execution is no longer the bottleneck, what is? Field's answer was unequivocal: <strong>point of view</strong>. "The design craft, point of view is the differentiator," he said. Getting an output to a prompt is "only a first step." Even the way you construct that first prompt requires deep judgment. And then you need to think about the entire system — multiple surfaces, multiple modalities, consistency, brand, emotional connection. Without a genuine point of view, "in the increasingly competitive landscape of software, you're just not going to make it." When asked directly whether taste is teachable, Field was thoughtful: "I think it's learnable... everyone has their own journey." But he was clear that this is where <span class="highlight">human judgment becomes the most valuable asset</span> — not in the execution of design, but in the curation and direction of it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="insight-card">
      <div class="label">Key Insight</div>
      <p>AI is raising the floor for creation — anyone can generate fifty design variations from a prompt. But <strong>the ceiling is set by human judgment</strong>. Taste, point of view, and the ability to navigate complex constraint spaces are becoming the scarcest and most valuable skills in software.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="narrative-section" id="s4" data-section="s4">
      <div class="section-label"><span class="num">04</span> Don't fight the models <span class="line"></span></div>
      <p>One of Field's most practical observations was deceptively simple: <strong>don't fight the models</strong>. "If you try to take the models and make them good at something they're not good at, that's generally a bad idea. If you try to lean into where they're good, you will have more success." It sounds obvious, but Field acknowledged that it's a lesson "many in the room have learned many times." The deeper point was about product strategy in the AI age. Figma isn't trying to outpace foundation models — "the foundation models are increasing their capabilities at such speed that it's foolish to believe that you can outpace them." Instead, the strategy is to <span class="highlight">ride the wave and add something to it</span>. As models get better at diffusion and code generation, Figma gets better too — by building tools like Figma Weave (from their acquisition of Weavy) that let designers manipulate AI-generated outputs into polished, production-ready results. The AI output is "clay that you have to shape and put through a process."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="narrative-section" id="s5" data-section="s5">
      <div class="section-label"><span class="num">05</span> Flow state as the design goal <span class="line"></span></div>
      <p>Field saved his most emotionally resonant observation for the end. What delighted him most about AI in design wasn't the efficiency gains or the expanded capabilities — it was the <span class="highlight">state of flow</span>. "As you make it so that people can be more efficient, they just love it. It's more of a state of flow that you can be in." Small things — adding images to a canvas, generating copy tweaks, rapid prototyping — keep designers in the creative zone rather than hopping between tools and losing their thread. He connected this back to FigJam's success during the pandemic: yes, it was about timing and product quality, but it was also about <strong>emoji reactions, stamps, cursor waves</strong> — the tiny moments of human connection that created psychological safety for brainstorming. In a world obsessed with AI automation, Field was making a quietly radical argument: the goal of AI in design isn't to replace the designer. It's to keep them <em>in the zone</em> longer, remove the friction, and let the human element shine through. "You can move a lot faster but ship worse stuff," he warned. The real challenge — and the real opportunity — is moving faster while shipping <strong>better</strong>.</p>
