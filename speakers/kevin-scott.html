    <div class="narrative-section" id="s1" data-section="s1">
      <div class="section-label"><span class="num">01</span> Seven years of seeing it coming <span class="line"></span></div>
      <p>G2 Patel introduced Scott with a personal anecdote: seven years ago, he'd asked the Microsoft CTO what was coming, and Scott had simply shaken his head and said <strong>"everything is going to get turned upside down."</strong> That prediction anchored the entire conversation. Scott confirmed the trajectory wasn't surprising — scaling laws were clearly going to work, models were going to behave like platforms — but the <em>speed</em> exceeded even his expectations.</p>
      <p>This wasn't false modesty. As the architect of Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI, Scott had a front-row seat to the shift from narrow machine learning (predicting ad clicks) to <span class="highlight">general-purpose AI platforms</span> that anyone could build on. His proudest achievement, he said, was helping democratize access — making it so anyone with an API key could start building, rather than having one Silicon Valley company decide what gets done with AI.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="narrative-section" id="s2" data-section="s2">
      <div class="section-label"><span class="num">02</span> The demographic imperative <span class="line"></span></div>
      <p>Then Scott did something unexpected for a tech CTO: he made the case for AI as a <strong>survival mechanism</strong>, not a business strategy. He shared a conversation with a friend who runs a premier educational institution in Japan. The offhand remark that stopped him cold: <em>"This year is peak high school graduation in Japan."</em> From here on, fewer students every year. Fewer going to college. Fewer entering the workforce. And it's not just Japan — China, Korea, Western Europe, even the US sans immigration.</p>
      <p>The implications are staggering and under-discussed. An <span class="highlight">aging population</span> creates more work (elder care, healthcare, social services) while simultaneously shrinking the labor pool to do it. Something fundamental has to change in how societies get work done. Scott's argument: <strong>thank god AI has come along when it has</strong>. Without it, the demographic math is brutal and destabilizing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pull-quote">
      <p>"The optimistic case is probably the more likely one because it's the necessary thing that has to happen."</p>
      <div class="attribution">— Kevin Scott, on AI and demographic necessity</div>
    </div>

    <div class="narrative-section" id="s3" data-section="s3">
      <div class="section-label"><span class="num">03</span> No diminishing returns in sight <span class="line"></span></div>
      <p>When pressed on the current state of AI capability, Scott was emphatic: <strong>we are not yet at the point of diminishing marginal returns</strong>. The platform infrastructure powering AI keeps producing outsized capability gains with each increment of investment. He pointed to coding as the closest glimpse of full model utilization — an "absolute frenzy" where even the most senior engineers are overwhelmed trying to keep pace.</p>
      <p>The demand numbers backed him up. Microsoft's most ambitious coding agent teams spend roughly <strong>$150,000 per year in inference costs per developer</strong> — and that's just a tiny slice of the developer community accessing that level of capability. Scale that across every developer, every knowledge worker, every enterprise, and the demand for compute becomes almost incomprehensible. Scott said he keeps expecting supply to catch up with demand, and it never does.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="insight-card">
      <div class="label">Key Insight</div>
      <p>AI isn't primarily a business opportunity — it's a <strong>demographic necessity</strong>. Major economies face population decline and aging workforces. Without AI-driven productivity gains, maintaining current quality of life becomes mathematically impossible.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="narrative-section" id="s4" data-section="s4">
      <div class="section-label"><span class="num">04</span> Activity versus progress <span class="line"></span></div>
      <p>Scott brought 25 years of engineering management wisdom to bear on a crucial distinction: <strong>don't confuse activity with progress</strong>. Coding agents can produce enormous volumes of code. Nothing guarantees it's <em>good</em> code. Review has become the bottleneck. And the fundamental question of what constitutes actual engineering productivity — which the industry has never truly answered — is now more urgent than ever.</p>
      <p>His prescription was characteristically grounded. The vocational aspects of software engineering will change radically. What endures is <span class="highlight">computer science thinking</span>: algorithmic decomposition, understanding your problem domain, having the curiosity to punch through layers of abstraction when the machine gives you the wrong answer. He was "grumpy" — his word — that CS education had become vocational training for programming. AI is about to force a return to fundamentals.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="narrative-section" id="s5" data-section="s5">
      <div class="section-label"><span class="num">05</span> From zero-sum to abundance <span class="line"></span></div>
      <p>Scott closed on what felt like a deeply held philosophy rather than a talking point. The zero-sum problems — scarcity, constraints, winners and losers — are <strong>"miserable."</strong> The thing technology should do is convert those zero-sum challenges into non-zero-sum ones. He'd said it before to G2 in a previous conversation, and he repeated it here with even more conviction: this is literally the reason to build technology.</p>
      <p>His pessimistic scenario wasn't the Terminator. It was more insidious: that society gets distracted by the superficial — his kids making green llamas with big butts instead of pursuing biomedical engineering projects. That AI becomes entertainment rather than the tool that solves the <strong>urgent, unsexy problems</strong> that demographic collapse is about to force on every major economy. The optimistic case, he insisted, is more likely — because it's the necessary one. And necessity, as it always has, will drive invention.</p>
