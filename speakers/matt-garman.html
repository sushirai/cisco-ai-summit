      <p>Garman opened with the question every CIO is silently asking: why are hundreds of AI proof-of-concepts going nowhere? His diagnosis was disarmingly simple. Most companies launched experiments without <strong>defined success criteria</strong>. They asked teams to run hundreds of experiments and roll them out — but never specified what "success" would look like. So even when experiments worked, nobody could prove they worked, and nobody could justify moving them to production.</p>
      <p>This is the <span class="highlight">messy middle</span> of AI adoption: the gap between "we're experimenting" and "this is in production, delivering value." Garman positioned it not as a technology problem but as a management discipline problem. The companies that are succeeding aren't the ones with the best models — they're the ones that started with clear metrics and worked backward.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="narrative-section" id="s2" data-section="s2">
      <div class="section-label"><span class="num">02</span> Measure what matters <span class="line"></span></div>
      <p>Then came the anecdote that crystallized Garman's point. At the JP Morgan Health Conference, he met two hospital administrators back-to-back who had both deployed AI ambient listening — automatically transcribing doctor-patient conversations into Epic records and insurance forms. Both had the same result: doctors got their evenings back, spending more time with families instead of doing notes.</p>
      <p>The first administrator was frustrated: <strong>"I haven't saved a single dollar. I haven't fired a doctor."</strong> The second told the same story — but added one crucial detail: <em>"My attrition number has gone down."</em> In a world where replacing a doctor costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, that's transformative ROI. Same deployment, same technology, <strong>radically different conclusions</strong> — because one measured the right thing and the other didn't.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pull-quote">
      <p>"I haven't saved a single dollar... but... attrition number has gone down."</p>
      <div class="attribution">— Matt Garman, quoting a hospital administrator on AI's real value</div>
    </div>

    <div class="narrative-section" id="s3" data-section="s3">
      <div class="section-label"><span class="num">03</span> AI coding: start from zero <span class="line"></span></div>
      <p>Garman's perspective on AI-assisted coding was the most operationally specific of the summit. AWS has teams that are seeing <strong>10x to 100x improvement</strong> — but only when they start from scratch. Teams with a mandate to write no line of code themselves, only prompting models, create a flywheel: the AI builds context, documents everything it writes, and can then test its own code because it understands the full system.</p>
      <p>The hard part — and he was candid about this — is <span class="highlight">legacy systems</span>. Large distributed codebases like S3, with years of accumulated complexity, don't yet yield the same dramatic speedups. The deeper in the stack you go, the harder it gets. Memory management, object durability, correctness guarantees — these are fundamentally different from "build me a website." But he predicted that within six to nine months, they'd crack the legacy code problem too.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="insight-card">
      <div class="label">Key Insight</div>
      <p>The AI adoption gap isn't about model capability — it's about <strong>measurement discipline</strong>. Companies that define success criteria upfront and measure operational resilience (attrition, quality, speed) rather than immediate cost savings are the ones successfully moving from PoC to production.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="narrative-section" id="s4" data-section="s4">
      <div class="section-label"><span class="num">04</span> Sovereign cloud and the trust geography <span class="line"></span></div>
      <p>Fresh from Davos, Garman reported a pattern that defined nearly every European conversation: <strong>"We trust you. I don't know if I can trust your country."</strong> European companies recognize they can't tie their hands behind their backs and refuse the world's best technology — but they're genuinely worried about what happens if the US government decides to "turn them off."</p>
      <p>AWS's response was the EU Sovereign Cloud, launched just weeks before the summit: a fully separate subsidiary incorporated in the EU, beholden to EU laws, with an independent governing board. Every bit of data — including metadata, account logins, everything — lives inside EU regions. They'd even tested <strong>disconnecting the entire region from the AWS backbone</strong> to prove it could operate independently. Co-designed with Germany's BSI, it was the most concrete answer to the <span class="highlight">sovereign AI infrastructure</span> question anyone had offered.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="narrative-section" id="s5" data-section="s5">
      <div class="section-label"><span class="num">05</span> Guardrails let you run <span class="line"></span></div>
      <p>Garman closed with an analogy that stuck: imagine a board laid across a giant canyon. Without guardrails, you crawl across it. <strong>Add handrails and walls, and you can run.</strong> It's the same board — the same technology, the same capability — but the guardrails change everything about how fast you're willing to move.</p>
      <p>This was his answer to the CIO audience's deepest anxiety: companies are slow to deploy AI not because the technology doesn't work, but because they're terrified of what goes wrong when agents make mistakes in production. The solution isn't to slow down — it's to build the guardrails that let teams run fast with confidence. AWS's Agent Core, he said, was designed precisely for this: providing the <span class="highlight">safety scaffolding</span> that turns cautious experimentation into full-speed production deployment.</p>
