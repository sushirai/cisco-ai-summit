      <div class="section-label"><span class="num">01</span> AI becomes a weapon of war <span class="line"></span></div>
      <p>Anne Neuberger didn't open with platitudes about AI's commercial potential. She opened with a stark reframing: <strong>AI is now a national security issue of the highest order</strong>. Not in the abstract, speculative sense that policy wonks have debated for years, but in the immediate, operational sense — AI is already shaping the outcomes of real conflicts. She drew directly from her role overseeing cyber and emerging technology policy, making clear that the conversations happening in boardrooms about AI adoption are <em>also</em> happening in situation rooms, with considerably higher stakes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="narrative-section" id="s2" data-section="s2">
      <div class="section-label"><span class="num">02</span> Machine-speed conflict <span class="line"></span></div>
      <p>The most visceral moment came when Neuberger described the reality of <span class="highlight">machine-speed conflict</span>. When missiles are inbound, she explained, human reaction time is simply too slow. The decision loop — detect, assess, decide, act — must happen in seconds, not minutes. "We are totally dependent right now on technology working," she said, her voice carrying the weight of someone who has sat in those rooms when the alerts go off. "If those missiles hit, you're going to have thousands of casualties." This wasn't hypothetical. This was <strong>operational reality</strong>, delivered to a room full of technologists who suddenly understood their work in a very different light.</p>

    <div class="narrative-section" id="s3" data-section="s3">
      <div class="section-label"><span class="num">03</span> The adversary moves faster <span class="line"></span></div>
      <p>From defense, Neuberger pivoted to offense — specifically, how <span class="highlight">adversarial adoption of AI</span> is outpacing the US. Criminals don't have procurement cycles. Hostile states don't have congressional oversight hearings. They don't debate safety frameworks or wait for NIST guidelines. They take the models, strip the guardrails, and deploy. She painted a picture of an asymmetric race where the side constrained by democratic norms and regulatory process is inherently slower to field new capabilities — and where that speed gap could be <strong>catastrophic</strong>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="narrative-section" id="s4" data-section="s4">
      <div class="section-label"><span class="num">04</span> Defense integration imperative <span class="line"></span></div>
      <p>Neuberger's prescription was unambiguous: the US must move to <strong>rapid deployment of defensive AI</strong> across military and intelligence infrastructure. Not pilot programs. Not five-year roadmaps. Now. She described the challenge of integrating AI into systems designed decades ago — missile defense networks, cyber operations centers, intelligence fusion platforms — while maintaining the reliability that national defense demands. The tension was palpable: move too slowly and adversaries gain advantage; move too hastily and a misaligned AI system could create the very catastrophe you're trying to prevent.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="insight-card">
      <div class="label">Key Insight</div>
      <p>AI in national security isn't about competitive advantage — it's about <strong>survival at machine speed</strong>. The gap between adversarial AI adoption and US defensive deployment is the most dangerous vulnerability in modern warfare.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="narrative-section" id="s5" data-section="s5">
      <div class="section-label"><span class="num">05</span> The regulation paradox <span class="line"></span></div>
      <p>She closed by naming the paradox that haunts every national security professional working on AI: <strong>the very regulation needed to ensure AI safety could slow the deployment needed to ensure national safety</strong>. It's not that regulation is wrong — it's that the adversary doesn't wait for your compliance framework. Neuberger left the audience with an uncomfortable truth: AI is not just a commercial tool to be optimized for enterprise value. It is a <span class="highlight">munition in modern warfare</span>, and the companies building it are, whether they like it or not, part of the defense industrial base of the twenty-first century.</p>
