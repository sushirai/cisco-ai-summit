      <div class="section-label"><span class="num">01</span> The 50-year productivity crisis <span class="line"></span></div>
      <p>Andreessen didn't start with AI. He started with economics — specifically, the <span class="highlight">productivity stagnation</span> that has gripped the developed world since roughly 1971. Growth rates at historical lows. Real wages flat for decades. Every previous technology wave — PCs, the internet, mobile — was supposed to fix this, and none did. Not really. Not at the macro level. His setup was deliberate: AI isn't just another technology cycle. It's the <strong>only viable candidate</strong> to break a half-century economic drought. The subtext was unmistakable — if we screw this up, there isn't a Plan B.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="narrative-section" id="s2" data-section="s2">
      <div class="section-label"><span class="num">02</span> The regulatory threat <span class="line"></span></div>
      <p>From economics, Andreessen pivoted to the thing he clearly fears most: regulation. He described the previous administration's trajectory toward "extreme overregulation" — up to and including "possibly full outlawing of the technology, which is very spooky." The new federal landscape is better, he acknowledged, but the action has shifted to the states, where <strong>thousands of AI bills</strong> are now proliferating. "Many of them are actually quite scary," he said, noting that AI regulation has become a bipartisan cause — politicians in both parties competing to restrict it. Europe, he added, is "quite alarming," with countries actively trying to <span class="highlight">"kneecap American technology"</span>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pull-quote">
      <p>"We were headed towards extreme overregulation... up to and including possibly full outlawing of the technology, which is very spooky."</p>
      <div class="attribution">— Marc Andreessen, on the regulatory landscape</div>
    </div>

    <div class="narrative-section" id="s3" data-section="s3">
      <div class="section-label"><span class="num">03</span> The values race <span class="line"></span></div>
      <p>Then came the geopolitical turn that elevated the entire conversation. Andreessen framed the AI competition with China not as a technology race but as a <span class="highlight">values race</span>. "If the world runs on American AI," he said, "generally speaking, the AI is going to have the values that we're used to — IP will be respected, privacy will be protected." If the world runs on Chinese AI? Not so much. He drove the point home with a vivid example: Chinese AI models like DeepSeek include benchmark tests for <strong>Marxism and Xi Jinping Thought</strong>. "It turns out the Chinese models are really good at Marxism and Xi Jinping Thought," he said, to uneasy laughter.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="narrative-section" id="s4" data-section="s4">
      <div class="section-label"><span class="num">04</span> The open source wildcard <span class="line"></span></div>
      <p>Andreessen complicated his own argument by naming the <span class="highlight">open source wildcard</span>. The US leads in frontier capabilities, but every major advance gets replicated — often within months, often at a fraction of the cost, often as open source. China isn't just copying; it's innovating. And when models are released openly, export controls on chips become less effective. You can deny hardware, but you can't un-release a model. This creates what Andreessen described as a potential <strong>business model disruption</strong> layered on top of the technological competition — Chinese companies offering comparable capabilities for free or at a third of the cost, potentially commoditizing the very profit pools American labs depend on to fund the next generation of research.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="insight-card">
      <div class="label">Key Insight</div>
      <p>The real threat isn't that China builds a better model. It's that <strong>open source and cost disruption could commoditize American AI's profit pools</strong> — starving the labs of the revenue they need to maintain their lead while Chinese alternatives proliferate freely.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="narrative-section" id="s5" data-section="s5">
      <div class="section-label"><span class="num">05</span> Grandkids and the other model <span class="line"></span></div>
      <p>Andreessen closed with what may have been the most memorable line of the entire summit. After laying out the Marxism benchmarks, after describing the values embedded in Chinese AI systems, he paused and said: <strong>"I don't know about you, but I want my grandkids educated by the other kind of model."</strong> It landed like a thunderclap — a venture capitalist reducing the entire geopolitical AI competition to the most personal possible terms. Not GDP growth, not military advantage, not market share. <em>Whose values will shape my grandchildren's minds?</em> It was a masterful closing that made the abstract concrete and the policy personal, leaving no doubt about the civilization-level stakes Andreessen believes are in play.</p>
