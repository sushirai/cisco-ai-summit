      The person whose product decisions — from API pricing to agent capabilities — will directly determine how enterprise organizations work in 12-24 months. When he says "the capability overhang is the biggest it's ever been," that's not abstract futurism — it's a signal about what's landing on your desk next quarter.
    </div>

  <div class="tldr">
    <div class="label">TL;DR</div>
    <ul>
      <li>Codex is his "second ChatGPT moment" — Cisco's AI Defense product going 100% Codex-written within weeks</li>
      <li>The upper limit he sees: <strong>"full AI companies"</strong> — AI that builds businesses, not just code</li>
      <li>The <strong>capability overhang</strong> (gap between what AI can do vs what orgs use it for) is now larger than pre-ChatGPT</li>
      <li>Real blockers aren't model intelligence — it's that existing software isn't built for human+AI co-use</li>
      <li>Prediction: models feel <strong>~10x better by end of 2026</strong></li>
      <li>Companies not set up for "AI co-workers" will be at a <strong>huge disadvantage</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="pull-quote">
    <p>"I swore I'd never give Codex full control of my computer. That lasted about two hours."</p>
    <div class="attribution">— Sam Altman, on agent autonomy</div>
  </div>

  <div class="narrative">
    <p>Altman opened with a personal confession: Codex, OpenAI's coding agent, gave him his biggest "update" on AI in a long time — <strong>a second ChatGPT moment</strong>. He anchored this immediately in Cisco's own experience, noting G2's team would have 100% of AI Defense code written by Codex within weeks. Not a demo — a proof point from the interviewer's own company.</p>

    <p>From there he escalated deliberately. He moved from coding agents to <span class="highlight">"full AI companies"</span> — AI that doesn't just write software but builds a business around it. Called it "the upper limit I can currently think about," his way of saying the ceiling keeps moving.</p>

    <p>Then came a fascinatingly honest admission. He installed Codex, swore he'd never give it full control — <strong>lasted about two hours</strong> before caving because it was too useful. Now runs two laptops because he couldn't resist giving AI full access to his sessions. This personal anecdote conveyed more about agentic AI's power than any benchmark.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="insight-card">
    <div class="label">Key Insight</div>
    <p>The real blockers aren't about model intelligence. They're about the fact that <strong>your existing software stack isn't built for a world where agents and humans share the same tools.</strong> Altman's example: his AI reads Slack threads but marks everything as read, breaking his workflow. Mundane — but aimed directly at every CIO in the room.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="narrative">
    <p>The deepest concept was the <span class="highlight">"capability overhang"</span> — the gap between what AI <em>can</em> do and what organizations actually use it for. He said this gap feels bigger now than it was right before ChatGPT launched, even though everyone's already using AI. His advice was blunt: companies that can't quickly adopt "AI co-workers" will be at a huge disadvantage, and getting there requires thinking of AI as a <strong>teammate, not a tool</strong>.</p>

    <p>He closed on scale, framing AI demand like electricity — infinite at the right price. Predicted a <strong>10x improvement in models by end of 2026</strong>. When pressed on imagination limits, offered a vision from billions of humanoid robots to Von Neumann probes in space — then admitted "beyond that, I got no idea."</p>

    <p>A rare moment of genuine humility from someone who otherwise projected total conviction that AI is about to reshape everything.</p>
